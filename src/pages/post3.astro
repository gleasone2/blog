    <p class="mb-4">
      In recent years, many MMORPGs have adopted the WoW-style loot system, where players are rewarded with loot drops that are randomized and based on luck. While this system may work well for some games, it is not a good fit for Final Fantasy XIV (FF14).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Firstly, FF14 already has a well-established loot system that has been refined over many years. The game's loot system is based on a points-based reward system, where players earn points for participating in content and can spend those points on specific items. This system provides a fair and consistent way for players to earn rewards and ensures that players who put in the effort are rewarded appropriately.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Adding a WoW-style loot system to FF14 would not only be unnecessary but could also undermine the existing system. The WoW-style system relies heavily on luck and chance, which could lead to players feeling frustrated and demotivated if they are consistently unlucky. Additionally, the WoW-style system would likely be more difficult to balance and could lead to some players feeling like they are being unfairly rewarded or punished.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Furthermore, the addition of a WoW-style loot system could lead to a shift in the game's focus towards grinding and farming for loot drops, rather than enjoying the content itself. FF14 is known for its engaging storylines and immersive world, and introducing a loot system that prioritizes grinding and farming could take away from those elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, adding a WoW-style loot system to FF14 is a bad idea. The game's existing points-based reward system is fair and consistent, and introducing a luck-based system could undermine it. Additionally, the focus on grinding and farming for loot drops could take away from the game's immersive world and engaging storylines. It's important for game developers to consider the unique aspects of their game when implementing new systems and features, and in the case of FF14, the existing loot system is already working well.
