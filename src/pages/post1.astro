    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Which Legend of Zelda Timeline Is Better?</h1>
    <div class="prose">
      <p class="mb-4">Legend of Zelda is one of the most beloved video game series of all time, but there is a longstanding debate among fans about which timeline is the best. The series has three main timelines: the Child Timeline, the Adult Timeline, and the Downfall Timeline.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Child Timeline is generally considered the most coherent and emotionally resonant, with memorable games like Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess. The Adult Timeline features standout games such as Wind Waker and Breath of the Wild, but the timeline can feel disjointed. The Downfall Timeline includes the original Legend of Zelda and other classics, but the games in this timeline can feel disconnected from the rest of the series.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on personal preference. Each timeline has its own strengths and weaknesses, and there is no clear winner in terms of quality or coherence. However, many fans tend to gravitate towards the Child Timeline for its emotional depth and consistency.</p>
